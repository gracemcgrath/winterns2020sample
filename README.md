# 2020 Winternship Public API Explorer
For this wintternship, we are building a proof of concept for a public API explorer. Users can interface with the different endpoints, or access information from them more easily without needing to run curl requests. 

## Gitpod Setup
1. Create a new branch in Github, and copy the issue URL at the end of `https://gitpod.io/#` or add the chrome extension (which adds the GitPod button to your Github account)
2. Make your changes
3. Commit them to Github using the commands `git add -u`, `git commit -m {commit message}`, `git push`

### To Run the flask App
1. Activate the virtual environment with `source helloWorld/bin/activate`
2. Make sure you are in the directory with the `app.py` file
3. Run ```flask run```
4. Click to port 500 through Gitpod, or preview in the sidebar.
